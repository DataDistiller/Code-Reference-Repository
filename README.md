## Chapter 1 - Creation of a Pandas DataFrame : 15 ways

While learning Data Science / ML Engineering, especially during EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Phase,  one often comes across the need to create a dataframe. 
It may be for a quick testing (few records) or to load data for actual modeling/EDW (many records).

Here's a cheat sheet that shows around 15 ways to create a Pandas data frame. Helps me a lot until I get used to it after months and years of practice. 

Sharing it for learners.
